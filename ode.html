                                <p>The Ode to Joy is an ode written in the summer of 1785, and it was originally written by playwright Fredrich Schiller. Beethoven used this piece in his fourth and final movement of the Ninth Symphony, which was completed in 1824. However Beethoven's text is not entirely based on Schiller's poem, and it has a few new sections.</p>

                                <p>Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer, and was born in 1770. He is famous for his piece called Ode to Joy. However, whilst performing Ode to Joy, Beethoven was completely deaf, and had no way of hearing his wonderous creation. Beethoven was born into a family of 9, his mother was Maria Keverich, and his father was Johann Beethoven. Despite having 7 siblings, only 2 of them survived infancy. Beehtoven was never married, even though he wrote a famouse piece called Für Elise for the German opera singer Elisabeth Röckel. Beethoven died in 1827, and he still today remians one of the most admired composers of Western music.</p>
